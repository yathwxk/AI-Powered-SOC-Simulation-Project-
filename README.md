# AI-Powered SOC Simulation Project

A simulation-based Security Operations Center (SOC) framework for real-time log monitoring, threat detection, and explainable incident reporting.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Explainable AI: SHAP / LIME
- Linux log simulation and custom alerting engine

## 🚀 Features
- Simulated brute-force and anomalous login attempts across IPs
- Real-time log parsing and rule-based/machine learning threat detection
- Explainable AI (XAI) overlays for decision interpretability
- Automated incident reports with severity scoring and mitigation steps
